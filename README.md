### Hi there, I'm Zhor Diffallah! ðŸ‘‹

![Profile Views](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=zhordiffallah&color=blueviolet)

I'm a dedicated researcher with a keen interest in the intricacies of sound and audio processing. My endeavors in the world of research revolve around leveraging limited labeled data and maximizing the potential of semi-supervised techniques. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently intrested in enhancing sound event detection systems, especially in scenarios with limited labeled data availability.
- ðŸŒ± Expanding my horizons on teacher-student techniques like mean teacher, interpolation consistency training, guided learning, and more.
- ðŸ’¬ Discuss with me: **Sound event detection systems, consistency regularization methods, knowledge distillation, or anything related to sound data and AI**.
